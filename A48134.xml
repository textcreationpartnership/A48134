            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S upon the removall of his <hi>Majesty</hi> from <hi>Holdenby,</hi> against his will, by a party of the Army under the command of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> we expressed our sence, and the resentment of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> of that violent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so the Committee of Estates of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scotland,</hi> finding that his <hi>Majesty</hi> is still kept within the Power of that Army, thought themselves obliged to endeavour to know the certainty of His condition: in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their commands, wee have applyed our selves to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> that from himselfe wee might know the truth thereof, who was pleased to shew us his usage, ever since Hee came from <hi>New castle,</hi> but for His present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Hee really confesseth He cannot, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48429:3"/>us to know it, from the two Houses of Parliament, and the Army.</p>
            <p>Both Houses (by many Professions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements) have declared to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> that they would take care of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of His Person, His just power and greatnesse, (which both Kingdomes have sworne not to diminish) and the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> upon the <hi>Kings</hi> going to <hi>Holdenby,</hi> did declare against all harme, prejudice, injury, or violence to be done to his Royall Person. Therefore in pursuance of the trust committed to us, we make this addresse to the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houses, conceiving it needles to apply our selves to the Army, who we suppose are, and ought to be under their command, desiring to know from them the certainty of His <hi>Majesties</hi> condition: and the rather that wee are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, there are intentions in the Army of the removing him from <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> finding that their stability, and happinesse doth so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the safety and preservation of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Royall Person, And being resolved that no alteration of affaires shall ever seperate
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48429:3"/>them from that duty Allegiance they owe unto him, nor from their constant resolution to live in all loyalty and obedience under His govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have often shewen their earnest desires, and contributed their utmost endeavours, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the composure of these unhappy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. And the Houses of Parliament ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by their Votes of the 26. of <hi>October</hi> last, intimated to us their resolutions to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to His Majesty, and that they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Propositions to be tendred to Him; Wee do desire that they may be expedited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us; that according to our many engagements and relations, there may be still a conjunction of Councells, in those things that are for the Common peace and joynt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And for the better assetting of them, for the clearing His <hi>Majesties</hi> doubts, and for the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and receiving mutuall satisfaction: We doe desire (in the name of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi>) that there may be a personall Treaty with his <hi>Majesty,</hi> as the best and readiest means to obtaine the joynt desires of both Kingdoms; And for that effect, that the King may be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>These wee conceive to be the most probable and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall meanes for attaining an happy peace, setling of Religion, restoring His Majesty to his just Rights, and continuing, and strengthening, a good understanding betwixt these Kingdomes, which are most earnestly desired by the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> And shall be constantly and faithfully endeavoured by</p>
